# Lab-4-Comparison-of-the-performance-of-HEAP-structures
 Algorithm design and analysis, Lab 4

Implement B+ tree.
Compare tree performance for different maximum numbers per node: 3, 5, 10, 33, 101, 333 and 1001. Test add, delete, search and between and' for trees that have 100, 1000, 10k, 100k and 1M knots. The number of samples per test should be 10% of the number of nodes in the initial tree. The values stored in the nodes should be natural numbers.
