# Lab-4-Comparison-of-the-performance-of-HEAP-structures
 Algorithm design and analysis, Lab 4

Implement binary and binomial heap.
Take integers from the range 0 to 10000 for node values.
After generating the structure, test it on the following action sequence:
- Extract-min for random 10% of the elements
- Reduction key for random 10% of elements
- Delete the node for random 10% of the elements
- Add for new 10% items
